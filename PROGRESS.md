# PROGRESS — Gnome Colony task ledger

Generated from docs/implementation-plan.md Appendix A. The loop agent checks items off
only when their Definition of Done is met (tests green, lint clean, committed).
Tasks are listed in plan order; do the FIRST unchecked task whose deps are checked.
🎮 lines are HUMAN playtest gates: write AWAIT_PLAYTEST.md, commit, and STOP until a
human records GO here.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold & test harness
- [x] T0.1 Project skeleton — project.godot (main scene presentation/main.tscn), dir tree, test_smoke.gd; boot exit 0
- [x] T0.2 Install GUT + test command — plugin enabled in project.godot, commands documented in README_DEV.md (GUT pre-vendored; upstream gut_loader.gd:35 prints a benign SCRIPT ERROR, doesn't affect results)
- [x] T0.3 Lint/format gate — .gdlintrc (defaults + addons/.godot excluded), ./lint.sh gate; CLAUDE.md lint command now ./lint.sh
- [x] T0.4 `Rng` singleton — sim/rng.gd autoload (extends Node is the Godot autoload requirement, mandated by the plan; no scene state); mixed-API replay, gauss mean, bounds, chance extremes proven in test_rng.gd
- [x] T0.5 `WorldConfig` resource — sim/world_config.gd (RefCounted, all setup §3–§5 defaults + quicken_budget 300); normalize() clamps/validates. seed & colony_name are wizard-filled placeholders.
- [x] Phase-Exit 0: test_smoke.gd passes headless; Rng reproduces a fixed sequence from a seed → tagged phase-0-complete (14/14 tests, 428 asserts, lint clean, verified from a wiped .godot/ cache)

## Phase 1 — Core data model & time
- [x] T1.1 Enums & constants — Enums class (LifeStage + trait/need/belief-axis catalogs). KNOWLEDGE_CATEGORIES ids "craft/tech/magic" are a naming choice for §7's prose, not spec-literal strings.
- [x] T1.2 `GnomeData` — full §1 state + clamp helpers; add_knowledge() enforces set semantics. MEMORY_CAP=16 is a structural constant (spec says only "small"), not a gameplay number.
- [x] T1.3 `Colony` registry — id map, next_id, living(), remove. Delivered full §5 vitals (not just a stub) + spawn()/population() helpers; public API: spawn/add/remove/living/population/vitals.
- [x] T1.4 `TimeService` — 1 tick = 1 day per algo §17 (plan's "ticks/day=4" is a pre-review fossil; §17 wins). Reminder for T6.2: propagation runs DAILY (design-review R3-H1), not every 4 ticks.
- [x] T1.5 Serialization round-trip — Serializer static to_dict/from_dict for GnomeData/Colony/WorldConfig, deep-copied (no aliasing). Full save-game serializer deferred to T12.1 as planned.
- [x] Phase-Exit 1: colony of 4, 100 ticks, calendar exact, state intact (test/integration/test_phase1_exit.gd) → tagged phase-1-complete. NOTE: canonical test command now includes -ginclude_subdirs (integration tests live in test/integration/).

## Phase 2 — Life cycle
- [x] T2.1 `EventBus` — autoload with the 6 core signals; world_ended deferred to T11.4 as planned.
- [x] T2.2 Aging & stage transitions — Aging.stage_for_age + tick; exact §17 bands; emits stage_changed.
- [x] T2.3 Mortality — Gompertz + hardship + accident, per-component rolls give cause attribution; hard cap 115. PUBLIC API: GnomeData.hardship_rate added (T3.5 writes it); Serializer updated accordingly.
- [x] T2.4 Birth scaffold — Birth.spawn_infant placeholder (sex via Rng, born event); inheritance/fertility deferred to Phase 5.
- [x] Phase-Exit 2: seeded 50-year elder-cohort run; lifespans in §4 bounds (mean ∈ [85,100], cap 115); one gnome_died per gnome → tagged phase-2-complete

## Phase 3 — Needs & utility decision
- [x] T3.1 Needs decay — §17 rates + stage mods; safety recovers −0.06/day toward 0.
- [x] T3.2 Action catalog — 7 §6 actions, exact relief vectors + stage/ctx gates; "create" = §6's create/explore row.
- [x] T3.3 Utility scoring — need²·relief with side costs subtracting; work trait_mod 0.7+0.6·industrious; culture/belief mods are ctx hooks (T6.4 wires them); jitter U(0,0.05) via Rng. SIGN CONVENTION: catalog deltas are signed (negative reduces a need); Utility scores with −delta; Act (T3.4) must apply raw deltas via adjust_need.
- [x] T3.4 Decide & act loop — Decide.choose (max utility, idle fallback), Act.apply (signed deltas; eat draws MEAL_UNITS=1.0 — implementation unit). ResourceNode (§15) pulled forward, constructor-parameterized, no invented defaults.
- [x] T3.5 Hardship link — sustained ≥0.9 hunger/safety >5 days ⇒ hardship_rate 0.15/day. Tracking placed in needs.gd (owns need updates) rather than the plan's "edit mortality.gd" — Mortality already consumes hardship_rate. PUBLIC API: GnomeData.hardship_days added; serializer covers it.
- [x] T3.6 Projects — persist unless a need ≥0.9 (reuses HARDSHIP_THRESHOLD); completion applies §6 create relief. PUBLIC API: Decide.choose can now return "project:<kind>"; GnomeData.project added; serializer covers it.
- [x] Phase-Exit 3: hungry colony + food node self-recovers via Needs→Decide→Act (mean hunger 0.8 → <0.3 in 14 days, no deaths) → tagged phase-3-complete

## Phase 4 — Skills, knowledge, teaching, extinction
- [x] T4.1 Proficiency & practice — asymptotic practice gain; knowledge id tracks the 0.2 teachability line both directions (reviewer made me strip teach/decay back out to T4.2/T4.3 — good catch).
- [x] T4.2 Teaching transfer — 0.03·(t−l)·q·dt; id at 0.2, chain teaches onward. teacher_quality q: spec leaves undefined → explicit param default 1.0. The t≤l no-op guard is an interpretive addition (the raw §17 formula would DECREASE a better learner) — teaching only pulls up.
- [x] T4.3 Decay & un-teachable — unused −0.002/day (used_skills exempt); below 0.2 forfeits the id; practice re-earns it.
- [x] T4.4 Extinction (per-settlement) — Knowledge.sync/check_extinction; regional loss with knowledge_lost events. PUBLIC API: Colony.settlement_knowledge + durable_records added (serializer covers them). No orchestrator yet — systems still composed by tests, per phase design.
- [x] T4.5 Writing durability — snapshot_records where "writing" is known; durable ids extinction-proof; study_record re-teaches from the page at the practice rate (spec defines no separate record rate — interpretive choice).
- [x] Phase-Exit 4: sole holder dies untaught ⇒ extinction; taught apprentice or writing prevents it; craft restorable from record → tagged phase-4-complete

## Phase 5 — Relationships, reproduction, genetics (= prototype Milestone 1)
- [x] T5.1 Relationship edges — 0.05·sign·compat symmetric step, idle decay 0.001/day. compat = 1 − mean|Δtrait| (interpretive; spec says only "rises with similarity").
- [x] T5.2 Partnership — mutual mate ≥0.6, Adults, unpartnered; culture-permitted hook (Callable, default allow) for T6 norms; deterministic sorted matching.
- [x] T5.3 Fertility & births — 0.15·food·(1−crowding)/season per fertile pair; bearer = sex 0 aged 20–50 (arbitrary tag, documented); kin edges start at 0 weight (no spec value). PUBLIC API: GnomeData.generation added; Birth.spawn_infant takes optional parents.
- [x] T5.4 Genetic inheritance — per-trait blend + N(0,0.05), 2% extra N(0,0.2) (per-trait reading of §8, reviewer-confirmed); skills never inherited.
- [x] T5.5 Trait plasticity — Culture stub: young drift 0.02·(env−trait)/day, linear taper 14→20 (interpretive curve), constitutional traits exempt. PUBLIC API: GnomeData.constitutional_traits added (T5.7 populates; serializer covers).
- [x] T5.7 Outlier births — p=0.01/birth, uniform type pick (interpretive); mutant traits out-of-band (edge ± U(0.1,0.5), interpretive magnitude), raw-written and inherited unclamped w/ marker; touched prophet_affinity=1. PUBLIC API: GnomeData.outlier_type + prophet_affinity added (serializer covers).
- [x] T5.6 Milestone integration test — 17/20 seeded runs reach gen 5 (bar: ≥12); chronicle logs births/deaths. PUBLIC API: SimRunner added (headless orchestrator; company picks implement §8 assortative mating); Social.form_partnerships now frees widowed slots (interpretive — dead partners can't hold one; test_partnership updated with real-spouse premise + widowhood test). NOTE: the milestone test adds ~5 min to every full-suite run.
- [x] Phase-Exit 5 (Milestone 1): 4-gnome colony, default WorldConfig — 17/20 seeded runs reached gen 5 (failures 3/20 ≤ 40%) → tagged phase-5-complete

## Phase 6 — Culture & belief (hybrid)
- [x] T6.1 Scalar substrate — appraise (intensity·susceptibility − habituation, never inverted), habituation +0.15/−0.02/day, relaxation −0.03/day. susceptibility 0.5+0.5·trait (interpretive; fear→timid faith→devout awe→curious reverence→devout). PUBLIC API: GnomeData.habituation added (serializer covers).
- [x] T6.2 Batched propagation — 0.04·tie·gap daily (R3-H1: NOT every 4 ticks), fear ×1.5, two-pass batched (one edge/day max), dead excluded.
- [x] T6.3 Crystallization — min holders max(5, ceil(3%·pop)) (rounding interpretive), ≥0.7 sustained a season (dip resets), strength = mean feeling × holder fraction. REVIEW FIX: §9 triggers overlap and ALL fire (taboo←fear/reverence, rite←awe/faith, place_reverence←reverence, theology←faith); taboo avoidance bites via the object (cursed tags reserved for Phase-7 phenomena chains); blessed tag = mean feeling. PUBLIC API: Colony.beliefs/place_tags/belief_tracker (serializer covers); BeliefObject factory.

- [ ] T10.2 Discovery process
- [ ] T10.3 Tech effects

## Phase 12 — Persistence & determinism
- [ ] T12.1 Full serializer
- [ ] T12.2 Determinism harness (input-scoped) (test_determinism.gd)
- [ ] T12.3 `WorldConfig` ingestion

## Notes
(The agent appends one-line notes here when checking tasks off, and records any public-API changes other tasks depend on.)
- Setup: GUT v9.5.0 pre-vendored at addons/gut/ during repo bootstrap (GitHub archive downloads are blocked in the build environment; raw file fetch was used). T0.2 should wire/verify it, not fetch it.
